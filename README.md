Hello! for this repo to work as intended first make sure after cloning the repository and extracting, navigate to the project folder (cd into it) and run the following command on the terminal to install all the required dependencies: "npm install".
The dependency "doteven" requires you to make 2 .env. files one for test and one for development, which inside of each you want to put "PGDATABASE=" and after the "=" put the name of the database you want to test/develop.
You can run tests using the "npm t" command which uses jest.

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
